//DOM - Document Object Model - The DOM is a structured representation of an HTML document. The DOM is used to connect webpages to scripts like JavaScript. JavaScript and the DOM are two different things.
//When a webpage loads the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page. The HTML DOM is constructed as a tree of objects.
//With the Object Model JavaScript can change, add new, remove and react to HTML elements and CSS styles.
